## 🚀 Why Choose LangFair?
Static benchmark assessments, which are typically assumed to be sufficiently representative, often fall short in capturing the risks associated with all possible use cases of LLMs. These models are increasingly used in various applications, including recommendation systems, classification, text generation, and summarization. However, evaluating these models without considering use-case-specific prompts can lead to misleading assessments of their performance, especially regarding bias and fairness risks.
 
LangFair addresses this gap by adopting a Bring Your Own Prompts (BYOP) approach, allowing users to tailor bias and fairness evaluations to their specific use cases. This ensures that the metrics computed reflect the true performance of the LLMs in real-world scenarios, where prompt-specific risks are critical. Additionally, LangFair's focus is on output-based metrics that are practical for governance audits and real-world testing, without needing access to internal model states.

**Note:** This diagram illustrates the workflow for assessing bias and fairness in text generation and summarization use cases.

## ⚡ Quickstart Guide
### (Optional) Create a virtual environment for using LangFair
We recommend creating a new virtual environment using venv before installing LangFair. To do so, please follow instructions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

### Installing LangFair
The latest version can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install langfair
```

### Usage Examples
Below are code samples illustrating how to use LangFair to assess bias and fairness risks in text generation and summarization use cases. The below examples assume the user has already defined a list of prompts from their use case, `prompts`. 

##### Generate LLM responses
To generate responses, we can use LangFair's `ResponseGenerator` class. First, we must create a `langchain` LLM object. Below we use `ChatVertexAI`, but **any of [LangChain’s LLM classes](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) may be used instead**. Note that `InMemoryRateLimiter` is to used to avoid rate limit errors.
```python
from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAI
from langchain_core.rate_limiters import InMemoryRateLimiter
rate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter(
    requests_per_second=4.5, check_every_n_seconds=0.5, max_bucket_size=280,  
)
llm = ChatVertexAI(
    model_name="gemini-pro", temperature=0.3, rate_limiter=rate_limiter
)
```
We can use `ResponseGenerator.generate_responses` to generate 25 responses for each prompt, as is convention for toxicity evaluation.
```python
from langfair.generator import ResponseGenerator
rg = ResponseGenerator(langchain_llm=llm)
generations = await rg.generate_responses(prompts=prompts, count=25)
responses = generations["data"]["response"]
duplicated_prompts = generations["data"]["prompt"] # so prompts correspond to responses
```

##### Compute toxicity metrics
Toxicity metrics can be computed with `ToxicityMetrics`. Note that use of `torch.device` is optional and should be used if GPU is available to speed up toxicity computation.
```python
# import torch # uncomment if GPU is available
# device = torch.device("cuda") # uncomment if GPU is available
from langfair.metrics.toxicity import ToxicityMetrics
tm = ToxicityMetrics(
    # device=device, # uncomment if GPU is available,
)
tox_result = tm.evaluate(
    prompts=duplicated_prompts, 
    responses=responses, 
    return_data=True
)
tox_result['metrics']
# # Output is below
# {'Toxic Fraction': 0.0004,
# 'Expected Maximum Toxicity': 0.013845130120171235,
# 'Toxicity Probability': 0.01}
```

##### Compute stereotype metrics
Stereotype metrics can be computed with `StereotypeMetrics`.
```python
from langfair.metrics.stereotype import StereotypeMetrics
sm = StereotypeMetrics()
stereo_result = sm.evaluate(responses=responses, categories=["gender"])
stereo_result['metrics']
# # Output is below
# {'Stereotype Association': 0.3172750176745329,
# 'Cooccurrence Bias': 0.44766333654278373,
# 'Stereotype Fraction - gender': 0.08}
```

##### Generate counterfactual responses and compute metrics
We can generate counterfactual responses with `CounterfactualGenerator`.
```python
from langfair.generator.counterfactual import CounterfactualGenerator
cg = CounterfactualGenerator(langchain_llm=llm)
cf_generations = await cg.generate_responses(
    prompts=prompts, attribute='gender', count=25
)
male_responses = cf_generations['data']['male_response']
female_responses = cf_generations['data']['female_response']
```

Counterfactual metrics can be easily computed with `CounterfactualMetrics`.
```python
from langfair.metrics.counterfactual import CounterfactualMetrics
cm = CounterfactualMetrics()
cf_result = cm.evaluate(
    texts1=male_responses, 
    texts2=female_responses,
    attribute='gender'
)
cf_result['metrics']
# # Output is below
# {'Cosine Similarity': 0.8318708,
# 'RougeL Similarity': 0.5195852482361165,
# 'Bleu Similarity': 0.3278433712872481,
# 'Sentiment Bias': 0.0009947145187601957}
```

##### Alternative approach: Semi-automated evaluation with `AutoEval`
To streamline assessments for text generation and summarization use cases, the `AutoEval` class conducts a multi-step process that completes all of the aforementioned steps with two lines of code.
```python
from langfair.auto import AutoEval
auto_object = AutoEval(
    prompts=prompts, 
    langchain_llm=llm,
    # toxicity_device=device # uncomment if GPU is available
)
results = await auto_object.evaluate()
results['metrics']
# # Output is below
# {'Toxicity': {'Toxic Fraction': 0.0004,
#   'Expected Maximum Toxicity': 0.013845130120171235,
#   'Toxicity Probability': 0.01},
#  'Stereotype': {'Stereotype Association': 0.3172750176745329,
#   'Cooccurrence Bias': 0.44766333654278373,
#   'Stereotype Fraction - gender': 0.08,
#   'Expected Maximum Stereotype - gender': 0.60355167388916,
#   'Stereotype Probability - gender': 0.27036},
#  'Counterfactual': {'male-female': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.8318708,
#    'RougeL Similarity': 0.5195852482361165,
#    'Bleu Similarity': 0.3278433712872481,
#    'Sentiment Bias': 0.0009947145187601957}}}

## 🛠 Choosing Bias and Fairness Metrics for an LLM Use Case
Selecting the appropriate bias and fairness metrics is essential for accurately assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specific use cases. Instead of attempting to compute all possible metrics, practitioners should focus on a relevant subset that aligns with their specific goals and the context of their application.

Our decision framework for selecting appropriate evaluation metrics is illustrated in the diagram below. For more details, refer to our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10853) detailing the evaluation approach.

</p>

**Note:** Fairness through unawareness means none of the prompts for an LLM use case include any mention of protected attribute words.
